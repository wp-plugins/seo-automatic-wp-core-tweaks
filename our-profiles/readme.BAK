== Description ==
This plugin lets the user fill in their profile URLs in the admin, then use a shortcode on a page or post to display the logos and links for 23 different services. If the review service allows it, like Yelp, you can copy / paste that URL to link people directly to "Leave a Review". 

Two sizes of logos are available, and a widget is also included. Yeah we know it needs more sizes... 

The services supported are:

*   Google+ 
*   Yelp 
*   Bing 
*   Judy's Book 
*   Yahoo Local 
*   Facebook (why not?)

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.


1. Using the WP admin uploader, install the zipped plugin. Alternatively, you can unzip locally, thenmanually  FTP the lowest level folder into your  `/wp-content/plugins/` directory. 

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

3. Visit the plugin settings page to add your profile URLs, or be smart and link directly to your "Leave a review" link at Yelp, or wherever you can.

4. Use the shortcode (shown at the top of the admin screen)  any page or post. 


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What does this plugin do? =

Allows you to easily create a looking page with links to your business profiles. You can then send your users to this page in various ways, trying to get them to leave you a review.  

= Should I link directly to my profile page? =

You could, yes, and from there users can leave a review. However, if you link directly to the button action for "leave a review" at each service, you'll likely have better results. 

Not all services support this, but MANY do. At Yelp, for example, just right click "Leave a Review" , choose to "open in a new tab" (a.k.a browser window) and if it works, use that URLs. If it doesn't show you the option when you right click, then you can't use it there.

= What if I have more than one location? =

At this time the plugin only supports a single location, and a multi-locational version may become available at some time in the future.
