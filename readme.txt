Extends built-in features of Wordpress and combines common plugins into one.

== Description ==

This plug-in completely automates the "proper" setup of your WordPress blog for search engine optimization.

Primarily for use in new WP installations, the steps are based on an employee checklist from Search Commander, Inc. for setting up new blogs.

Almost everything is covered, from changing the permalink structure to deleting the "Hello World" sample post & comment, and all the options are accessible from one single page.

It also extends the built-in features of Wordpress and combines 4 other useful plugins into this one...

This plug-in is designed to be a companion to other plugins like All in one SEO or Headspace, and is not intended as a replacement.

This plug-in should be installed before any others, because it automates the proper setup of Word press. To be sure things work properly, it's best to deactivate any plugins that you may have already activated.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is this plugin for? =

It will add a new Admin menu item, "SEO Automatic", with a sub-menu named "Core Tweaks".

This plugin saves a lot of time properly setting up a new Wordpress installation by allowing one page access for the things that must be changed for every installation, and combines functionality of several other plugins.

= What if I already have a Wordpress site up and running? =

Then this plugin won't save you nearly as much time, but will combine several useful plugins into one. Deactivate any plugins that are turned on, and be sure to UNcheck any options in the admin panel that you may have already completed, or don't need to change.

= What if I forgot to deactivate one of the included plugins first? =

Then you are probably getting a fatal error when trying to activate. Read the error note details.

You should find a plugin name in the error. Deactivate it and try activating Core Tweaks again. Core Tweaks cannot automatically deactivate them for you for security reasons.

= Does core tweaks work with Windows servers? =

Windows server's are not currently supported.
