== Description ==

Extends built-in features of WordPress and combines common plugins into one.

== Installation ==

1. Unzip the download
2. Upload the entire folder: `sc-wp-core-tweaks` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
4. Set options in Settings > Core Tweaks for changing the WordPress preinstalled installation options.
5. Post Teaser, Page Link Manager, and Page Order will automatically be installed with this plugin and can be found in the normal locations and used the same as always.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is this plugin for? =

Adds a new option under the "Settings" menu called "Core Tweaks", and saves a lot of time properly setting up a new Wordpress installation by allowing instant access for the things that must be changed for every installation. It also combines functionality of several other plugins.

= What if I already have a WordPress site up and running? =

Then this plugin won't save you nearly as much time.

== Screenshots ==

1. This screen shot description corresponds to screenshot-1.(png|jpg|jpeg|gif). Note that the screenshot is taken from
the directory of the stable readme.txt, so in this case, `/tags/4.3/screenshot-1.png` (or jpg, jpeg, gif)

== Arbitrary section ==

You may provide arbitrary sections, in the same format as the ones above.  This may be of use for extremely complicated
plugins where more information needs to be conveyed that doesn't fit into the categories of "description" or
"installation."  Arbitrary sections will be shown below the built-in sections outlined above.

== A brief Markdown Example ==

Unordered list:

Added with version 0.9b

   * Corrected Cheatin’ Huh? message, but need more testing by beta testers to be sure since this requires a fresh wordpress install.
   * Added ability to change blog description/tagline.
   * Added attempt to create uploads folder and set permission to 777. (Will work depending on what your hosting server allows.)
   * Added uncheck option for the organize uploads by month/year.

            "Markdown is what the parser uses to process much of the readme file"

Markdown uses email style notation for blockquotes and I've been told:
> Asterisks for *emphasis*. Double it up  for **strong**.

`<?php code(); // goes in backticks ?>`
