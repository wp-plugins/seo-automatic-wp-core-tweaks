Almost everything you would do manually is covered, from changing permalink structure to deleting the Hello World sample post. All the options are accessible from one single page.

It also extends the built-in features of WordPress and combines 4 other useful plugins into this one.

This plug-in is designed to be a companion to other plugins like All in one SEO, Headspace, or WordPress SEO, and *is not* intended as a replacement. In fact, as they get better, we have disabled some of our features.

== Installation ==

After activation, go to the SEO Automatic > Core Tweaks admin screen and use the default choices or make choices of your own. 

Designed as a new setup assistant, this plug-in is usually installed before any others. If you've added other plugins and have them actice, deactivate them first to avoid potential conflicts, then REactivvate them after you run the setup process.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is this plugin for? =

This plugin saves 20 to 40 minutes of post-installation time, properly setting up a new WordPress installation. 

It adds a new Admin menu item, SEO Automatic - with a sub-menu Core Tweaks, giving access on one page to all of the things that savvy programmers change for every installation. 

For older themes that do not support custom menus, it also combines several other WP plugins for theme customization, turned off by default in the bottom of the admin screen.

= What if I already have a Wordpress site up and running? =

Then this plugin won't save you nearly as much time unless you've done little customization after your installation. Deactivate any plugins that are turned on, and be sure to UNcheck any options in the admin panel that you may have already completed, or that you don't need to change.

= Does core tweaks work with Windows servers? =

No - Windows servers are not currently supported, and never will be.

= What if I need more help? =
Please visit the <a href='http://www.seoautomatic.com/forum/wp-tweak-plugin/'>SEO Automatic Support Forum</a>, which should be pretty empty, since we have very few issues.

= Help! I have a missing/broken image on the privacy policy page created by Core Tweaks =

This has been corrected starting with version 3.71. The previous image supplied by freeprivacypolicy.com became unavailable and we didn't notice. 

If you have not edited your privacy policy after creation, either delete it and and use core tweaks to add one again after you have upgraded to 3.71 or higher, or much easier, manually edit your page to remove the broken image.

== Screenshots ==

1. Screenshot

== Other Notes ==

1. We recommend disabling any other plugins before running the process to minimize potential confilcts. There will be no conflicts when you re-enable them.

2. Your .htaccess file should be writable for your permalinks to change.
